# **Hello!**

Currently I am a student at Champlain College of Vermont studying to become a professional game programmer. Despite not having any previous programming experience before entering college, I've worked diligently to acquire the skills neccissary to become the best possible game programmer that I can be. Presently, I am currently working on multiple projects, some of which you can find here. If you've got any questions about myself or any of my projects, I'd love to talk to you, please email me at nhrobbins1@comcast.net.


## **RV-Punch**
**Action Racing-Game**  |  **(Unity 5, C#)**  |  **Team Size: 8**  |  **2017 - 2018** 
   
Players punch their opponents out of their way in this up to four player racing game, where they race as different model RVs equppied with giant mech fists. These fists act as the game's main mechanic which can be used to punch other racers off the track or stun them, activate or break objects within the racetrack environment, and even "jump" off the walls by punching them. 

Project made within Champlain College's Production 2 course.

## **Opportunity Knocks - Global Game Jam 2018**
**Adventure**  |  **(Unity 5, C#)**  |  **Team Size: 4**  |  **2018** 

This game's main mechanic inspired by the jam's theme of "transmission" has the player control the mars rover as it moves across the surface of the planet, but because of the weak connection between the player and the rover, the signal that you transmit to it is laggy. By making lag a central game mechanic, the player must be careful by not driving the rover down a cliffside and make it to the end of each level. The player may choose to "boost" the signal to reduce the lag, at the cost of using up more energy.
